# Getting Started
This wiki is a work in progress and will eventually replace the GitHub wiki.

# What is Insight?
Insight provides EVE Online killmail streaming for Discord. Insight can stream personal or corporate killboards, detect supercapitals with a proximity radar, and more! Insight is a Discord bot that can be directly invited to your server to provide your community with killmail streaming and intel in an easy-to-use package.

Insight is completely free and open-source and all code is available on [GitHub](https://github.eveinsight.net).

# How do I host Insight myself?
The easiest way to host Insight yourself is through [Docker](/install/docker).

# I need more help or want to offer suggestions.

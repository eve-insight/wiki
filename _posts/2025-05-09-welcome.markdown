## What is EVE Insight?
Insight provides EVE Online killmail streaming for Discord. Insight can stream personal or corporate killboards, detect supercapitals with a proximity radar, and more! Insight is a Discord bot that can be directly invited to your server to provide your community with killmail streaming and intel in an easy-to-use package.

Insight is completely free and open-source and all code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/eve-insight/Insight).
